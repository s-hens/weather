## Summary

This is a web app that displays the latest real-time weather data using [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/). The weather is visualised with minimalist CSS animations.

Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Full Stack JavaScript curriculum.

- Unique animations for clear, partly cloudy, overcast, rainy, and snowy weather during day and night
- Animations can be paused/unpaused at any time
